Here are the 6 issues formatted for GitHub:

## Issue 1: Add Rate Limit Caching to GitHubClient

**Title:** Add rate limit caching to reduce API calls and improve efficiency

**Labels:** enhancement, performance, rate-limiting

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem
The current `GitHubClient` implementation checks rate limits before every request by calling `self.client.ratelimit().get()`. This approach itself consumes rate limit quota, making it inefficient for high-frequency operations.

## Solution
Implement rate limit caching to reduce the frequency of rate limit API calls:

- Cache rate limit information for a configurable duration (default: 60 seconds)
- Only fetch fresh rate limit data when cache expires
- Clear cache when waiting for rate limit reset

## Benefits
- Reduces API calls by ~50-80% for rate limit checks
- Improves overall request efficiency
- Maintains rate limit protection while reducing overhead

## Implementation Details
- Add `rate_limit_cache: Arc<Mutex<Option<(octocrab::models::RateLimit, Instant)>>>`
- Add `cache_duration: Duration` field
- Implement `get_cached_rate_limit()` method
- Update `check_and_handle_rate_limits()` to use cached data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limit info is cached for configurable duration
- [ ] Cache is automatically invalidated when expired
- [ ] Cache is cleared when waiting for rate limit reset
- [ ] Reduced number of rate limit API calls
- [ ] Unit tests for caching logic
```

## Issue 2: Implement Adaptive Rate Limiting and Request Throttling

**Title:** Add adaptive throttling based on current rate limit status

**Labels:** enhancement, performance, rate-limiting

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem
The current implementation only reacts to rate limits when they're already exceeded or close to the buffer threshold. This can lead to bursty request patterns that may still hit rate limits.

## Solution
Implement adaptive throttling that introduces delays based on current rate limit usage:

- Calculate usage ratio (used requests / total limit)
- Introduce progressive delays when usage is high (>60%)
- Implement `adaptive_delay()` method for intelligent request spacing

## Benefits
- Smoother request distribution over time
- Proactive rate limit management
- Reduced likelihood of hitting rate limits during high-volume operations

## Implementation Details
- Add `adaptive_delay()` method
- Calculate delays based on usage ratio:
  - >80% usage: up to 1 second delay
  - >60% usage: proportional delay
- Configurable throttling enable/disable option

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Adaptive delays implemented based on usage ratio
- [ ] Delays are proportional to rate limit pressure
- [ ] Throttling can be enabled/disabled via configuration
- [ ] Logging for throttling decisions
- [ ] Performance tests showing smoother request patterns
```

## Issue 3: Add Dynamic Batch Size Management

**Title:** Implement adaptive batch sizing based on rate limit status

**Labels:** enhancement, performance, rate-limiting, graphql

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem
The current implementation uses fixed batch sizes (50 files per batch) regardless of rate limit status. This can be inefficient when rate limits are tight or wasteful when plenty of quota is available.

## Solution
Implement dynamic batch sizing that adapts to current rate limit availability:

- Reduce batch sizes when approaching rate limits
- Use full batch sizes when plenty of quota is available
- Consider both remaining requests and time until reset

## Benefits
- More efficient use of available rate limit quota
- Reduced risk of hitting limits during batch operations
- Better performance when quota is abundant

## Implementation Details
- Add `get_optimal_batch_size()` method
- Implement batch size calculation based on usage ratio:
  - >90% usage: batch_size / 4
  - >80% usage: batch_size / 2  
  - >60% usage: batch_size * 3/4
  - <60% usage: full batch_size
- Update `create_file_batches()` to use adaptive sizing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Batch sizes adapt to rate limit status
- [ ] Minimum batch size of 1 is enforced
- [ ] Logging shows batch size decisions
- [ ] Integration tests with various rate limit scenarios
- [ ] Performance metrics show improved efficiency
```

## Issue 4: Add GraphQL Query Complexity Management

**Title:** Implement GraphQL query complexity estimation and optimization

**Labels:** enhancement, performance, rate-limiting, graphql

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem
GitHub's GraphQL API has complexity limits that can cause queries to fail. The current implementation doesn't account for query complexity, potentially leading to failed requests for large batch operations.

## Solution
Implement query complexity estimation and management:

- Estimate complexity for GraphQL queries
- Split queries that exceed complexity limits
- Implement complexity-aware batching

## Benefits
- Prevents GraphQL complexity limit errors
- More reliable batch operations
- Better handling of large data sets

## Implementation Details
- Add `estimate_query_complexity()` method
- Implement `execute_complex_graphql()` with complexity-aware batching
- Add configurable max complexity limit (default: 1000)
- Base complexity calculation:
  - Base query: 1 point
  - Each file fetch: ~4 points
  - Repository access: 1 point

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Query complexity estimation implemented
- [ ] Queries automatically split when complexity exceeds limits
- [ ] Configurable complexity thresholds
- [ ] Error handling for complexity-related failures
- [ ] Unit tests for complexity calculations
- [ ] Integration tests with high-complexity scenarios
```

## Issue 5: Add Comprehensive Rate Limit Monitoring and Metrics

**Title:** Implement rate limit monitoring and metrics collection

**Labels:** enhancement, monitoring, observability, rate-limiting

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem
The current implementation lacks comprehensive monitoring of rate limit usage patterns, making it difficult to optimize performance and troubleshoot rate limiting issues.

## Solution
Implement comprehensive rate limit monitoring and metrics:

- Track total requests, rate-limited requests, and average remaining quota
- Periodic logging of rate limit status
- Metrics for performance analysis and optimization

## Benefits
- Better visibility into rate limit usage patterns
- Data-driven optimization opportunities
- Improved troubleshooting capabilities
- Performance monitoring and alerting support

## Implementation Details
- Add `RateLimitMetrics` struct with atomic counters
- Implement `log_rate_limit_metrics()` method
- Track metrics:
  - Total requests made
  - Number of rate-limited requests
  - Average remaining quota
  - Last reset time
- Structured logging with relevant context

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Metrics collection for all rate limit operations
- [ ] Periodic logging of rate limit status
- [ ] Atomic counters for thread-safe metrics
- [ ] Structured logging with proper context
- [ ] Documentation for metrics interpretation
- [ ] Optional metrics export capability
```

## Issue 6: Make Rate Limiting Configuration Flexible

**Title:** Add configurable rate limiting parameters

**Labels:** enhancement, configuration, rate-limiting

**Body:**
```markdown
## Problem
The current implementation has hardcoded rate limiting parameters (buffer size, batch sizes, etc.), making it difficult to tune performance for different use cases or environments.

## Solution
Make rate limiting parameters configurable through a dedicated configuration structure:

- Configurable rate limit buffer
- Adjustable cache duration
- Flexible batch sizing parameters
- Enable/disable toggles for various features

## Benefits
- Tunable performance for different environments
- Easy A/B testing of rate limiting strategies
- Better support for different GitHub API quota levels
- Simplified troubleshooting and optimization

## Implementation Details
- Add `RateLimitConfig` struct with all configurable parameters:
  - `buffer: u32` (default: 100)
  - `cache_duration_secs: u64` (default: 60)
  - `max_batch_size: usize` (default: 50)
  - `adaptive_batching: bool` (default: true)
  - `max_query_complexity: u32` (default: 1000)
  - `throttling_enabled: bool` (default: true)
- Add `new_with_rate_limit_config()` constructor
- Implement `Default` trait for sensible defaults

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All rate limiting parameters are configurable
- [ ] Sensible default values provided
- [ ] Configuration validation implemented
- [ ] Documentation for all configuration options
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Integration tests with various configurations
```
